            <p>
              I am a BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Los Baños with experience in frontend development through mobile and game projects.
              I have implemented user interfaces, profile pages, and interactive components, and worked closely with backend features such as authentication and data handling.
              I value clean, usable designs and enjoy building interfaces that improve user experience.
              I am currently focused on strengthening my frontend skills while collaborating effectively within a team.
