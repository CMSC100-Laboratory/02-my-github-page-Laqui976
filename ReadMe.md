Key Takeaways:    
This Laboratory exercise was able to portray the relationship between CSS and HTML. It showed me how CSS can give life to a simple HTML document.
Moreover, the exercise was able to stregthen my fundamentals of both HTML and CSS allowing me to explore different layouting commands. The importance of
